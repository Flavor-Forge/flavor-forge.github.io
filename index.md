# FlavorForge: <br /> Recipes for minimal kitchens and minimal cost

## Overview

FlavorForge aims to revolutionize how college students approach cooking by providing a platform where they can easily discover and share recipes that are tailored to their limited resources and dietary preferences. Our goal is to empower students to cook nutritious and delicious meals using minimal kitchen facilities and ingredients that are readily available near their campus.

## Our Vision

* Allow students to share and view recipes
* Students will be able to sort recipes by categories
* User can give a budget and recipes will be shown by price

### Home Page

The home page will be the first page seen when logged in. There will be a main image, information about the website and a featured recipe. The navbar at the top will have links leading to the other pages
