# FlavorForge: Quick and easy recipes

## Overview

FlavorForge aims to revolutionize how college students approach cooking by providing a platform where they can easily discover and share recipes that are tailored to their limited resources and dietary preferences. Our goal is to empower students to cook nutritious and delicious meals using minimal kitchen facilities and ingredients that are readily available near their campus.

## Our Vision

* Allow students to share and view recipes
* Students will be able to sort recipes by categories
* User can give a budget and recipes will be shown by price

### Home/Main Page

The home page is what users will be the first page seen when logged in. There will be information about pending requests for card trading, and the amount of card 

packages they currently have. Users will be able to open the package on this page and accept or deny the trading request

### Friend list page

This page is designed for users to manage their friend list. By clicking on a friend's profile, users can view the cards owned by that friend and initiate trade requests directly from there. Additionally, users have the flexibility to add new friends or remove existing ones by simply entering their username.

### Card Collection
